We will create two Clone repository to simulate Stash.
Check if git is installed. Let the url be https://github.com/ashishWaghmare/katacoda-scenarios which has to be replace by own url
`git --version`
Now since git is verified to be installed create two folder representing each developer
`git clone https://github.com/ashishWaghmare/katacoda-scenarios developer1` 
`git clone https://github.com/ashishWaghmare/katacoda-scenarios developer2` 

Make sure you got both folders with same content
`ls -ltr`{{execute}}

This should show two folder named `developer1` and `developer2`
